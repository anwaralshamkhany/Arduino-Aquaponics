This is a homemade, backyard friendly project that completely automates an aquaponics system from the fish feeder to the pump that cycles water. This a scable model with all the requirements and materials needed to build this in your backyard.

# Materials
* Any 6 to 12 volt water pump
* About 1 meter of tubing

* 1 100 liter plastic tub
* 4-6 plants of your choosing preferably green plants that will not consume too much nutrients from the water
* 10 Tilapia or fish of your choosing
* Arduino uno
* Jumper wires
* 9 volt dc adapter
* 9 volt jack wall power adapter
* arduino motor shield V1
* 1 mini servo motor

# Instructions for setup
Begin by soldering jumper wires to the 9 volt dc adapter and connect it to the input of the arduino motor shield. Plug in your servo directly to the servo pins at the top left which will be referrenced as 10 in the code.
