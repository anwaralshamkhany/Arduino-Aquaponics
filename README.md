# Arduino-Aquaponics
This is a homemade, backyard friendly project that completely automates an aquaponics system from the fish feeder to the pump that cycles water. This a scable model with all the requirements and materials needed to build this in your backyard.

# Materials
* Any 6 to 12 volt water pump
* About 1 meter of tubing
* 1 kilo of clay pebbles
* 1 100 liter plastic tub
* 4-6 plants of your choosing preferably green plants that will not consume too much nutrients from the water
* 10 Tilapia or fish of your choosing
* Arduino uno
* Jumper wires
* 9 volt dc adapter
* 9 volt jack wall power adapter
* arduino motor shield V1
* 1 mini servo motor
* 3D printer
* Super Glue
* 2 Standard machine screws and bolts
* 2 screws that already come packaged with the servo

# Instructions for setup
Begin by soldering jumper wires to the 9 volt dc adapter and connect it to the input of the arduino motor shield. Plug in your servo directly to the servo pins at the top left which will be referrenced as pin 10 in the code. Then upload the arduino file called feeder_and_pump_code.ino to you arduino uno. Next you can attach the pump directly to the 9 volt pin and GND as we will need the pump to run constantly. Now that we have the arduino setup we can 3D print all the required files for the automatic fish feeder. Further docuementation for the STL files will be linked below as I did not create them.
